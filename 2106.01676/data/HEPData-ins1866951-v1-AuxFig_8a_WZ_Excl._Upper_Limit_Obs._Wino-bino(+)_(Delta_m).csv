#: name: AuxFig 8a WZ Excl. Upper Limit Obs. Wino-bino(+) ($\Delta m$)
#: description:  Exclusion limits obtained for the $W\!Z$-mediated model, for the (1st and 2nd row) wino/bino (+) scenario, (3rd row) the wino/bino (-) scenario, and (4th row) the higgsino scenario, as in Figure 16. Black numbers represent the observed (a) and expected (b) upper cross-section limits.
