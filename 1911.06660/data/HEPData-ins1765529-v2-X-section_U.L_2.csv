#: name: X-section U.L 2
#: description: The observed upper limits on the model cross-section in units of pb for simplified models with ${\tilde{\tau}}_L {\tilde{\tau}}_L$ only production. Three points at $M({\tilde{\chi}}^{0}_{1})=200GeV$ were removed from the plot but kept in the table because they overlapped with the plot's legend and are far from the exclusion contour.
